  description: 'If introspection is disabled on your target, Field Suggestion can
    allow users to still earn information on the GraphQL schema.

    By default, GraphQL backends have a feature for fields and operations suggestions.

    If you try to query a field but you have made a typo, GraphQL will attempt to
    suggest fields that are similar to the initial attempt.

  impact: '- The attacker could gain information about the structure of the GraphQL
    schema, including the available types, fields, and their relationships.

    - The attacker could use the field suggestion feature to enumerate the existing
    fields and operations in the GraphQL API, even if introspection is disabled.

    - The attacker could leverage the information disclosed through the field suggestion
    feature to refine their attack and potentially uncover sensitive data or functionality.

    - The attacker could use the disclosed information to plan more sophisticated
    attacks, such as constructing targeted queries to extract additional data or perform
    unauthorized actions.

    - The information disclosure could lead to a further compromise of the application,
    as the attacker gains a better understanding of the system''s internals and potential
    attack vectors.'
  remediation: 'To address the "GraphQL Field Suggestion Information Disclosure" vulnerability,
    it is essential to disable the field suggestion feature in your GraphQL backend.
    This will prevent attackers from leveraging the field suggestion functionality
    to gather information about the schema, even if introspection is disabled. By
    removing this attack surface, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized
    access and further compromise of your application.


    - Locate the configuration settings for your GraphQL backend and identify the
    option to enable or disable the field suggestion feature.

    - Disable the field suggestion feature by setting the appropriate configuration
    parameter or flag.

    - Ensure that the field suggestion is disabled in both development and production
    environments to maintain consistent security across all deployments.

    - Review your application''s logging and monitoring systems to detect any attempts
    to exploit the field suggestion feature and respond accordingly.

    - Document the decision to disable the field suggestion feature and update your
    application''s security documentation to maintain a clear record of the implemented
    remediation.'
