  impact: '- Potential for code injection: An attacker could potentially inject malicious
    code into the external script or stylesheet, which could then be executed by the
    victim''s browser.

    - Sensitive data exposure: Malicious code injected by the attacker could be used
    to steal sensitive information from the victim, such as login credentials or personal
    data.

    - Targeted attacks: The vulnerability could be exploited to target specific users
    or groups, leading to more sophisticated and targeted attacks.

    - Bypass of security controls: The lack of SRI could allow the attacker to bypass
    certain security controls, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) or other web
    application security measures.

    - Persistent threats: If the external script or stylesheet is frequently loaded,
    the vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly, leading to persistent threats
    and ongoing security compromises.'
  remediation: 'To address the "Missing Subresource Integrity" vulnerability, developers
    should implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure the integrity of external
    script and stylesheet resources. SRI allows the browser to verify that the resources
    being loaded have not been tampered with, reducing the risk of code injection
    and other potential security issues.


    Specifically, developers should:


    - Identify all external script and stylesheet tags in the HTML response and add
    the appropriate SRI attributes.

    - Generate the SRI hash for each external resource by calculating the SHA-256
    or SHA-384 hash of the resource''s content.

    - Include the SRI hash in the `integrity` attribute of the corresponding `<script>`
    or `<link>` tag.

    - Regularly update the SRI hashes as the external resources are updated to maintain
    the integrity of the application.

    - Implement a process to monitor and update the SRI hashes in a timely manner
    to ensure the application remains secure.

    - Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) in addition to SRI to further
    strengthen the application''s security.'
