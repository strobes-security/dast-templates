  impact: '- Attacker could obtain sensitive information stored in the Tomcat cookie,
    such as session identifiers, user credentials, or other potentially confidential
    data.

    - Attacker could potentially hijack an authenticated user''s session by using
    the exposed Tomcat cookie, allowing them to access and manipulate the victim''s
    account.

    - Attacker could leverage the exposed Tomcat cookie to escalate their privileges
    and gain unauthorized access to the Tomcat server or other connected systems.

    - If the Tomcat cookie contains sensitive information, the attacker could use
    it to launch further attacks, such as phishing or targeted malware distribution,
    against the affected users or organization.

    - The exposed Tomcat cookie could allow the attacker to gather intelligence about
    the system''s architecture, configuration, or other valuable information that
    could be used in subsequent attacks.'
  remediation: 'To address the "Tomcat Cookie Exposed" vulnerability, it is essential
    to ensure that Tomcat cookies are properly secured and do not expose sensitive
    information. This can be achieved by implementing the following measures:


    - Encrypt the Tomcat cookies: Ensure that all Tomcat cookies are encrypted using
    a strong encryption algorithm, such as AES, to protect the confidentiality of
    the data they contain.

    - Implement secure cookie settings: Configure the Tomcat application to set the
    "HttpOnly" and "Secure" flags on the cookies, which prevent the cookies from being
    accessible by client-side scripts and ensure that they are only transmitted over
    secure (HTTPS) connections.

    - Limit the cookie''s lifespan: Reduce the expiration time of the Tomcat cookies
    to the minimum necessary, ensuring that they are valid only for the duration of
    the user''s session.

    - Implement session management best practices: Review and implement best practices
    for session management, such as generating unique session IDs for each user, invalidating
    sessions when the user logs out, and enforcing session timeouts.

    - Regularly review and update Tomcat configurations: Continuously monitor and
    update the Tomcat configuration to ensure that it remains secure and aligned with
    the latest security best practices.'
