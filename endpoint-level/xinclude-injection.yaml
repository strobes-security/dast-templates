  name: XInclude Injection - Detection
  author: DhiyaneshDK,ritikchaddha
  severity: high
  description: The XInclude Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious
    XInclude tags into the XML input processed by the application, potentially leading
    to sensitive file disclosure, arbitrary code execution, information leakage, and
    denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. By inserting crafted XInclude tags, an attacker
    can trick the XML parser into resolving and including external files or resources,
    granting the attacker access to sensitive information or enabling them to execute
    arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability arises due to inadequate input
    validation and sanitization, as well as overreliance on the XML parsing process
    without proper security measures. Addressing this issue requires implementing
    robust input validation, disabling unnecessary XML features, and maintaining up-to-date
    software dependencies to ensure the application is protected against XInclude
    Injection attacks.

  impact: '- An attacker could gain access to sensitive files and directories on the
    server by injecting malicious XInclude tags and successfully resolving them.

    - The attacker could leverage XInclude injection to execute arbitrary code on
    the server and potentially escalate privileges.

    - By inserting malicious XInclude tags, the attacker could disclose the server''s
    configuration and system details, which could be used for further attacks.

    - The attacker could perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by injecting large
    or recursive XInclude payloads, leading to excessive resource consumption on the
    server.

    - An attacker could potentially bypass security mechanisms and access restricted
    areas of the application by exploiting the trust placed in the XML parsing process.'
  remediation: 'To address the XInclude Injection - Detection vulnerability, the following
    remediation steps should be taken:


    Developers should implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms
    to prevent the injection of malicious XInclude tags into any user-supplied data
    that is subsequently processed by the XML parser. This includes, but is not limited
    to, validating and sanitizing all user input, including query parameters, form
    fields, and API request payloads, before incorporating them into the XML document.


    - Ensure that all user-supplied data is properly validated and sanitized before
    being used in the XML document.

    - Implement a whitelist-based approach to input validation, where only known-safe
    characters and values are allowed, rather than attempting to remove known malicious
    ones.

    - Consider disabling the XInclude feature in the XML parser unless it is absolutely
    necessary for the application''s functionality.

    - Implement strict error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and respond
    to any attempts of XInclude injection, and ensure that these events are properly
    reported and investigated.

    - Regularly review and update the application''s XML parsing libraries and dependencies
    to ensure they are up-to-date and not vulnerable to known XInclude Injection vulnerabilities.'
