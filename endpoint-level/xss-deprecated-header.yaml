  name: XSS-Protection Header - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: joshlarsen
  severity: info
  description: The "XSS-Protection Header - Cross-Site Scripting" vulnerability arises
    when the web application's configuration enables the XSS-Protection feature, which
    can actually introduce a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if set to anything
    other than '0'. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts
    into web pages, which would then be executed by the victim's browser. The consequences
    can be severe, as the attacker may be able to steal sensitive information, perform
    unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, or even gain unauthorized access
    to the victim's account or system. To address this issue, it is recommended to
    disable the XSS-Protection header entirely by setting it to '0', and instead focus
    on implementing robust server-side input validation and output encoding mechanisms
    to mitigate cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the application.

  impact: '- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages, which would
    be executed by the victim''s browser.

    - The attacker could steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, from
    the victim''s browser.

    - The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as making unauthorized
    purchases or sending spam emails.

    - The attacker could redirect the victim to a malicious website, compromising
    the victim''s security and privacy.

    - The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the victim''s account or system,
    potentially leading to further compromise.'
  remediation: 'To address the "XSS-Protection Header - Cross-Site Scripting" vulnerability,
    it is recommended to disable the XSS-Protection header entirely by setting it
    to `0`. This is because the XSS-Protection header can actually introduce an XSS
    vulnerability if set to anything other than `0`. Instead, focus on implementing
    robust server-side input validation and output encoding mechanisms to mitigate
    cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in your application.


    - Set the `X-XSS-Protection` header to `0` in your application''s configuration
    to disable the XSS-Protection feature.

    - Implement thorough server-side input validation and output encoding to ensure
    that all user-supplied data is properly sanitized before being displayed on the
    web pages.

    - Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of
    scripts and other potentially malicious content on your web pages.

    - Regularly review and update your application''s security measures to address
    emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

    - Educate your development team on the importance of secure coding practices,
    including the proper handling of user input, to prevent the introduction of XSS
    vulnerabilities.'
