  severity: info
  description: The 'X-Content-Type-Options' header is missing. This prevents MIME-type
    sniffing.

  impact: '- An attacker could trick the victim''s browser into executing malicious
    content, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by manipulating the Content-Type
    header.

    - Lack of the ''X-Content-Type-Options'' header allows the browser to perform
    MIME-type sniffing, which can lead to the execution of unintended content.

    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the attacker gaining
    unauthorized access to sensitive information or taking control of the affected
    system.

    - The absence of the ''X-Content-Type-Options'' header increases the risk of content
    injection attacks, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious code on
    the target system.

    - This vulnerability may enable the attacker to bypass security controls and gain
    a foothold within the target environment, potentially leading to further attacks
    or data breaches.'
  remediation: 'To address the "Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header" vulnerability,
    the following remediation steps should be taken:


    The ''X-Content-Type-Options'' header should be implemented on all web pages and
    web applications to prevent MIME-type sniffing and mitigate the risk of content
    injection attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This header instructs the
    browser to trust the declared Content-Type of the resource, rather than attempting
    to guess or sniff the content type, which can lead to the execution of unintended
    content.


    Specific steps for developers to follow:


    - Implement the ''X-Content-Type-Options'' header with the value ''nosniff'' on
    all web pages and web applications.

    - Ensure that the appropriate Content-Type header is set for all responses, accurately
    reflecting the type of content being served.

    - Review and update all server configurations to include the ''X-Content-Type-Options''
    header.

    - Conduct comprehensive testing to validate that the ''X-Content-Type-Options''
    header is properly implemented and effectively preventing MIME-type sniffing.

    - Implement ongoing monitoring and auditing processes to ensure the ''X-Content-Type-Options''
    header remains in place and continues to protect the application from this vulnerability.'
