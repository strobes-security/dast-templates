  classification:
    cwe-id: CWE-200
  metadata:
    max-request: 1
  tags: dns,ec2,aws
  impact: '- Identify the existence of an EC2 instance, potentially revealing information
    about the target''s infrastructure and web services.

    - Gain insights into the target''s cloud-based resources and architecture, which
    could aid in further reconnaissance and attack planning.

    - Leverage the knowledge of the EC2 instance to explore potential vulnerabilities
    in the underlying operating system, applications, or AWS services.

    - Attempt to pivot from the identified EC2 instance to gain unauthorized access
    to other cloud resources or the overall organization''s network.

    - With sufficient privileges, an attacker could modify, delete, or steal data
    stored on the EC2 instance, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity,
    or availability of critical information.'
  remediation: 'To address the "AWS EC2 Detection" vulnerability, organizations should
    take the following steps:


    Implement strict network access controls and monitoring to identify and prevent
    unauthorized access to EC2 instances. Ensure that EC2 instances are not publicly
    accessible, and enforce the principle of least privilege when granting access
    to these resources. Additionally, enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
    of EC2 instances to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.


    - Configure EC2 security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to limit
    inbound and outbound traffic to only authorized sources and destinations.

    - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users and roles with access
    to EC2 instances to enhance access control.

    - Regularly review and update access permissions for EC2 instances, ensuring that
    only authorized personnel have the necessary privileges.

    - Enable AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and log all activities
    related to EC2 instances, and configure appropriate alerting mechanisms to detect
    and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

    - Implement a robust patch management strategy to ensure that EC2 instances are
    running the latest versions of operating systems and software, reducing the risk
    of exploitable vulnerabilities.'
