  impact: '- An attacker could leverage the exposed Browserless debugger to make unauthorized
    web requests, potentially accessing sensitive data or functionality on the targeted
    system.

    - The attacker could attempt to locate and retrieve potentially sensitive files
    or documents stored in the /workspace directory of the Browserless instance.

    - With the ability to make web requests through the Browserless debugger, an attacker
    could attempt to exploit other vulnerabilities on the system or network, potentially
    leading to further compromise.

    - The Browserless debugger could be used as an entry point for an attacker to
    gain a foothold on the system and potentially escalate privileges or move laterally
    within the network.

    - The exposed Browserless debugger could allow an attacker to bypass security
    controls and bypass authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access
    or data exfiltration.'
  remediation: 'To address the "Exposed Browserless debugger" vulnerability, the following
    remediation steps should be taken:


    - Restrict access to the Browserless debugger by implementing strong authentication
    and authorization mechanisms. Ensure that only authorized personnel can access
    the debugger interface.

    - Disable the Browserless debugger if it is not required for the application''s
    functionality. If the debugger is necessary, limit its usage to development and
    testing environments, and ensure it is not exposed to the public internet.

    - Review the contents of the /workspace directory and remove or secure any sensitive
    files or documents that may be accessible through the debugger. Regularly audit
    the /workspace directory to ensure no sensitive information is stored in an exposed
    manner.

    - Implement network-level controls, such as firewalls or access control lists,
    to restrict access to the Browserless debugger from unauthorized IP addresses
    or networks.

    - Regularly monitor and review logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized
    access attempts to the Browserless debugger.'
