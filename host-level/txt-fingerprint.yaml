  classification:
    cwe-id: CWE-200
  metadata:
    max-request: 1
  tags: dns,txt
  impact: '- An attacker could leverage the DNS TXT record to store and retrieve arbitrary
    data, potentially including sensitive information or malicious scripts.

    - The TXT record could be used to host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure
    for a remote access trojan (RAT) or other malware, enabling the attacker to maintain
    persistent access to the target network.

    - Attackers could manipulate the TXT record to deliver phishing or social engineering
    payloads, tricking users into divulging credentials or executing malicious code.

    - The existence of the TXT record could indicate inadequate security controls
    or a lack of monitoring, potentially making the target organization more vulnerable
    to further attacks.

    - An attacker could use the TXT record to store and retrieve information about
    the network topology, user accounts, or other valuable data that could be used
    to expand the scope of the attack.'
  remediation: 'To address the "DNS TXT Record Detected" vulnerability, it is crucial
    to review the DNS configuration and remove any unnecessary or suspicious TXT records.
    TXT records can be abused by attackers to store and retrieve data, host malicious
    infrastructure, or deliver phishing payloads, posing a significant risk to the
    organization. The following steps should be taken to remediate this issue:


    - Identify and analyze all existing DNS TXT records: Review the DNS configuration
    to locate any TXT records and evaluate their purpose and content. Determine if
    any of the records are unnecessary or potentially suspicious.

    - Remove unnecessary or suspicious TXT records: Carefully remove any TXT records
    that are not essential for the organization''s operations or that contain suspicious
    content.

    - Implement strict DNS record management policies: Establish clear guidelines
    and procedures for creating, modifying, and monitoring DNS records, including
    TXT records, to prevent the introduction of unauthorized or malicious content.

    - Enhance network monitoring and logging: Implement robust network monitoring
    and logging mechanisms to detect any changes or additions to the DNS configuration,
    including TXT records, and promptly investigate any anomalies.

    - Educate and train personnel: Provide training to relevant IT staff and administrators
    on the risks associated with DNS TXT records and the importance of maintaining
    a secure DNS configuration.'
