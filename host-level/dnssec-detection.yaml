  description: Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are enabled. The Delegation
    of Signing (DS) record provides information about a signed zone file when DNSSEC
    enabled.

  classification:
    cwe-id: CWE-200
  metadata:
    max-request: 1
  tags: dns,dnssec
  impact: '- An attacker could potentially gather additional information about the
    target''s domain and DNS configuration, which could aid in further attacks.

    - The attacker could potentially identify the specific DNSSEC implementation,
    version, and configuration details, which could be used to discover and exploit
    vulnerabilities in the DNSSEC implementation.

    - The attacker could leverage the information from the DS record to attempt to
    spoof or tamper with the target''s DNS traffic, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle
    attacks or domain hijacking.

    - The attacker could use the DNSSEC information to target the domain''s registrar
    or DNS provider, potentially gaining access to the target''s domain management
    capabilities.

    - The attacker could attempt to exploit any weaknesses or misconfigurations in
    the DNSSEC implementation to bypass the security protections provided by DNSSEC.'
  remediation: 'To address the "DNSSEC Detection" vulnerability, security teams should
    consider implementing measures to reduce the visibility of DNSSEC-related information
    and strengthen the overall security posture. This can be achieved through the
    following steps:


    - Ensure that the DNSSEC implementation is up-to-date and configured securely,
    following the best practices recommended by the DNSSEC standard and the domain
    registrar or DNS provider.

    - Consider masking or obfuscating the DNSSEC-related information in the DNS records,
    such as the DS record, to minimize the information available to potential attackers.

    - Implement strong access controls and monitoring mechanisms for the domain management
    and DNS configuration, to detect and respond to any unauthorized access or modifications.

    - Regularly review and update the DNSSEC configuration and policies to address
    any newly discovered vulnerabilities or security concerns.

    - Educate the organization''s IT and security teams on the importance of DNSSEC
    and the potential risks associated with its detection, and ensure they are equipped
    with the necessary knowledge and tools to manage and secure the DNSSEC implementation
    effectively.'
