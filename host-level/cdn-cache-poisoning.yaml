  name: Misconfigured CDN Cache Poisoning via X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption Header
  author: 0xcharan
  severity: unknown
  description: 'When the X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption header is sent with user controlled
    value, it can lead to a misconfigured CDN cache response with a 400 status code,
    making the page inaccessible.

  impact: '- Attacker could inject malicious content into the CDN cache, leading to
    the delivery of malicious payloads to all subsequent visitors.

    - Attacker could cause a denial of service by poisoning the CDN cache with invalid
    responses, making the website inaccessible to legitimate users.

    - Attacker could potentially bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access
    to sensitive information stored in the CDN cache.

    - Attacker could leverage the vulnerability to launch further attacks, such as
    cross-site scripting (XSS) or other web application exploits, due to the compromised
    CDN cache.

    - Attacker could gain a foothold within the target''s infrastructure by exploiting
    the misconfigured CDN cache, potentially leading to further compromise of the
    system or network.'
  remediation: 'To address the "Misconfigured CDN Cache Poisoning via X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption
    Header" vulnerability, the following remediation steps should be implemented:


    Ensure that the CDN is properly configured to validate and sanitize the X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption
    header, preventing user-controlled values from being accepted and cached. This
    will mitigate the risk of cache poisoning and the potential delivery of malicious
    content to subsequent visitors.


    Specific steps for developers to follow:


    - Implement strict validation and sanitization of the X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption
    header at the CDN level to ensure that only valid, predefined values are accepted.

    - Configure the CDN to cache only responses with valid X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption
    headers, rejecting any responses with user-controlled or unexpected values.

    - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to any attempts
    to exploit the vulnerability, allowing for timely mitigation and incident response.

    - Review and update the CDN configuration regularly to ensure that the validation
    and sanitization measures remain effective and up-to-date.

    - Provide comprehensive training to the development and operations teams on the
    importance of properly configuring and securing CDN-related components to prevent
    similar vulnerabilities in the future.'
