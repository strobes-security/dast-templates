  name: NS Record Detection
  author: pdteam
  severity: info
  description: An NS record was detected. An NS record delegates a subdomain to a
    set of name servers.
  classification:
    cwe-id: CWE-200
  metadata:
    max-request: 1
  tags: dns,ns
  impact: '- Attackers could potentially hijack the targeted domain by modifying the
    NS record to point to their own malicious name servers.

    - Attackers could intercept and monitor all traffic to the targeted domain, potentially
    gaining access to sensitive information.

    - Attackers could set up their own web servers on the delegated subdomains and
    use them to host malicious content or conduct phishing attacks.

    - Attackers could use the compromised domain to launch further attacks, such as
    distributing malware or launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

    - The compromised domain could be used as a stepping stone for deeper network
    intrusion and lateral movement within the target organization.'
  remediation: 'To address the "NS Record Detection" vulnerability, it is crucial
    to review and properly manage your domain''s DNS configuration. Misconfigured
    or unauthorized changes to NS records can lead to significant security risks,
    such as domain hijacking, traffic interception, and the potential for further
    attacks.


    - Thoroughly audit your domain''s DNS settings to identify any unauthorized or
    unexpected NS records. Verify that all NS records are legitimate and managed by
    your organization.

    - Implement strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for making
    changes to your domain''s DNS configuration. Ensure that only authorized personnel
    can modify NS records.

    - Consider implementing domain protection services or registry locks to prevent
    unauthorized changes to your domain''s NS records.

    - Regularly monitor your domain''s DNS records and set up alerts to notify you
    of any changes, enabling you to respond promptly to potential threats.

    - Educate your team on the importance of maintaining a secure DNS configuration
    and the risks associated with NS record vulnerabilities.'
