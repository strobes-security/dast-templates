  description: ElasticBeanstalk subdomain takeover detected. A subdomain takeover
    occurs when an attacker gains control over a subdomain of a target domain. Typically,
    this happens when the subdomain has a canonical name (CNAME) in the Domain Name
    System (DNS), but no host is providing content for it.

    comments: 'Only CNAMEs with region specification are hijackable.

      You need to claim the CNAME in AWS portal (https://aws.amazon.com/) or via AWS
      CLI to confirm the takeover.

      Do not report this without claiming the CNAME.

      CLI command to verify the availability of the environment:

      aws elasticbeanstalk check-dns-availability --region {AWS_REGION} --cname-prefix
      {CNAME_PREFIX}

      For example:

      CNAME - 2rs3c.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

      Command - aws elasticbeanstalk check-dns-availability --region eu-west-1 --cname-prefix
      2rs3c

  impact: '- An attacker could potentially take control of the vulnerable subdomain,
    allowing them to host their own content and impersonate the target organization.

    - The attacker could use the hijacked subdomain to conduct phishing attacks, distribute
    malware, or carry out other malicious activities that appear to originate from
    the target organization.

    - The attacker could gain access to sensitive information or systems that are
    accessible through the vulnerable subdomain, potentially leading to further compromise
    of the target organization''s infrastructure.

    - The attacker could leverage the hijacked subdomain to launch attacks against
    other systems or users, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF) attacks.

    - The attacker''s control over the vulnerable subdomain could enable them to intercept
    and manipulate communication between the target organization and its customers
    or partners, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
    data.'
  remediation: 'To address the "ElasticBeanstalk Subdomain Takeover Detection" vulnerability,
    organizations should ensure that all subdomains are properly configured and actively
    managed. This includes regularly reviewing DNS records, ensuring that each subdomain
    has a valid host providing content, and promptly addressing any instances of unclaimed
    or unmanaged subdomains to prevent potential takeover attempts.


    - Review all DNS records associated with the organization''s ElasticBeanstalk
    instances and ensure that each subdomain has an active host providing content.
    Identify any subdomains that do not have a valid host and take immediate action
    to resolve the issue.

    - Implement continuous monitoring and detection mechanisms to identify any changes
    or new subdomains that may be created or modified without authorization. This
    can help detect potential subdomain takeover attempts in a timely manner.

    - Establish a clear process for managing and updating DNS records, including designating
    responsibilities and ensuring that any changes are properly documented and communicated
    to relevant teams.

    - Provide training and guidance to developers on the importance of properly configuring
    and maintaining subdomains, as well as the potential risks associated with subdomain
    takeover attacks.

    - Consider implementing security controls, such as content security policies (CSP)
    and strict transport security (HSTS), to mitigate the impact of successful subdomain
    takeover attempts and reduce the risk of further compromise.'
