  name: TYPO3 Debug Mode Enabled
  author: tess,FLX
  severity: low
  description: The TYPO3 Debug Mode Enabled vulnerability arises when the debug mode
    is left enabled in the production environment of the TYPO3 web application. This
    can lead to the unintended disclosure of sensitive information, such as database
    credentials, server configurations, and detailed error messages. Additionally,
    the enabled debug mode can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code on the server, bypass authentication mechanisms, and gain unauthorized access
    to administrative functions within the TYPO3 application. This vulnerability can
    be exploited to gather intelligence about the server's architecture and software
    versions, which can be used in subsequent attacks. Furthermore, the debug mode
    can disrupt the normal operation of the TYPO3 application, causing denial of service
    or other disruptions to the web application. To mitigate this vulnerability, the
    TYPO3 Debug Mode should be disabled in production environments, and a process
    should be implemented to regularly review and validate the TYPO3 configuration
    to ensure the debug mode remains disabled.

  impact: '- Gain access to sensitive information, such as database credentials, server
    configurations, and error messages that can be exploited for further attacks.

    - Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete compromise
    of the system.

    - Bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to administrative
    functions within the TYPO3 application.

    - Gather intelligence about the server''s architecture, software versions, and
    other valuable information that can be used in subsequent attacks.

    - Disrupt the normal operation of the TYPO3 application, causing denial of service
    or other disruptions to the web application.'
  remediation: 'The TYPO3 Debug Mode should be disabled in production environments
    to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information and potential exploitation
    by attackers. Leaving the debug mode enabled can lead to serious security risks,
    such as unauthorized access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service.
    To address this issue, developers should follow these steps:


    - Locate the TYPO3 configuration file (typically named "LocalConfiguration.php")
    and ensure that the debug mode is set to "false" or "0" for the production environment.

    - Review the application''s configuration settings and ensure that no other debug-related
    options are enabled, such as displaying error messages or enabling detailed logging.

    - Implement a process to regularly review and validate the TYPO3 configuration
    to ensure that the debug mode remains disabled in the production environment.

    - Consider implementing server-level controls, such as web application firewalls
    or intrusion detection/prevention systems, to detect and block attempts to access
    the TYPO3 debug mode.

    - Provide training and guidance to developers and operational staff to ensure
    they understand the security implications of leaving the debug mode enabled and
    the importance of properly configuring the TYPO3 application for production use.'
