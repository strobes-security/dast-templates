  impact: '- An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the phpMemcachedAdmin panel,
    which could allow them to view and manipulate sensitive information stored in
    the Memcached server.

    - The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server hosting
    the phpMemcachedAdmin panel, leading to a complete system compromise.

    - An attacker could use the exposed phpMemcachedAdmin panel to launch further
    attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, against the Memcached server
    or other related systems.

    - The attacker could leverage the phpMemcachedAdmin panel to launch cache poisoning
    attacks, potentially leading to the corruption or manipulation of data stored
    in the Memcached server.

    - The exposure of the phpMemcachedAdmin panel could also result in the disclosure
    of sensitive information, such as server configurations, database credentials,
    or other sensitive data, which could be used by the attacker in subsequent attacks.'
  remediation: 'The exposed phpMemcachedAdmin panel poses a significant security risk
    and should be addressed immediately. To mitigate this vulnerability, the following
    steps should be taken:


    - Restrict access to the phpMemcachedAdmin panel by implementing strong authentication
    mechanisms, such as two-factor authentication or role-based access control.

    - Limit the exposure of the phpMemcachedAdmin panel by placing it behind a secure,
    access-controlled web server or proxy, ensuring that it is not directly accessible
    from the internet.

    - Review and update the configuration of the Memcached server to ensure that it
    is properly secured, with appropriate access controls and logging mechanisms in
    place.

    - Ensure that all software components, including the phpMemcachedAdmin panel and
    the Memcached server, are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and
    updates.

    - Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and alert
    on any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities related to the phpMemcachedAdmin
    panel or the Memcached server.'
