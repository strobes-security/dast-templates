  severity: info
  description: The 'X-Frame-Options' header is missing. This prevents clickjacking
    attacks by restricting framing.

  impact: '- The lack of the X-Frame-Options header allows the website to be embedded
    within an attacker''s website, enabling clickjacking attacks.

    - Attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking
    on buttons or links, by overlaying the legitimate website with their own content.

    - Sensitive information displayed on the vulnerable website, including login forms,
    could be exposed to the attacker''s website, leading to potential data theft.

    - Unauthorized actions, like making purchases or transferring funds, could be
    performed on the user''s behalf without their knowledge or consent.

    - The vulnerability could be exploited to launch social engineering attacks, where
    users are manipulated into divulging sensitive information or granting access
    to restricted resources.'
  remediation: "To address the \"Missing X-Frame-Options Header\" vulnerability, the\
    \ recommended remediation is to implement the X-Frame-Options header on the affected\
    \ web application. This header is a critical security mechanism that helps prevent\
    \ clickjacking attacks by restricting the ability to embed the website within\
    \ an attacker's website.\n\nDevelopers should follow these steps to resolve the\
    \ issue:\n\n- Identify all the affected web pages or resources where the X-Frame-Options\
    \ header is missing.\n- Add the X-Frame-Options header to the affected pages or\
    \ resources, specifying the appropriate directive based on the application's requirements.\n\
    - The most common directives are:\n  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - This completely\
    \ disallows the website from being embedded in a frame, providing the highest\
    \ level of protection.\n  - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` - This allows the website\
    \ to be embedded only within pages served from the same origin (domain).\n- Ensure\
    \ that the X-Frame-Options header is set consistently across the entire web application\
    \ to maintain a robust and effective clickjacking protection mechanism.\n- Test\
    \ the changes thoroughly to verify that the X-Frame-Options header is correctly\
    \ implemented and that the website is no longer vulnerable to clickjacking attacks."
