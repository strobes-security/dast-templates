  severity: info
  description: The "Missing X-Frame-Options Header" vulnerability arises when a web
    application fails to include the crucial X-Frame-Options header in its HTTP responses.
    This header is a critical security mechanism that helps prevent clickjacking attacks
    by restricting the ability to embed the website within an attacker's website.
    Without this header, the affected website can be easily integrated into a malicious
    webpage, enabling the attacker to overlay their own content and trick users into
    performing unintended actions, such as clicking on buttons or links. This could
    expose sensitive information displayed on the vulnerable website, including login
    forms, leading to potential data theft. Furthermore, the vulnerability could be
    exploited to carry out unauthorized actions on the user's behalf, such as making
    purchases or transferring funds, without their knowledge or consent. Addressing
    this issue by implementing the appropriate X-Frame-Options header is essential
    to safeguard the website and its users against clickjacking attacks and associated
    security risks.

  impact: '- The lack of the X-Frame-Options header allows the website to be embedded
    within an attacker''s website, enabling clickjacking attacks.

    - Attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking
    on buttons or links, by overlaying the legitimate website with their own content.

    - Sensitive information displayed on the vulnerable website, including login forms,
    could be exposed to the attacker''s website, leading to potential data theft.

    - Unauthorized actions, like making purchases or transferring funds, could be
    performed on the user''s behalf without their knowledge or consent.

    - The vulnerability could be exploited to launch social engineering attacks, where
    users are manipulated into divulging sensitive information or granting access
    to restricted resources.'
  remediation: "To address the \"Missing X-Frame-Options Header\" vulnerability, the\
    \ recommended remediation is to implement the X-Frame-Options header on the affected\
    \ web application. This header is a critical security mechanism that helps prevent\
    \ clickjacking attacks by restricting the ability to embed the website within\
    \ an attacker's website.\n\nDevelopers should follow these steps to resolve the\
    \ issue:\n\n- Identify all the affected web pages or resources where the X-Frame-Options\
    \ header is missing.\n- Add the X-Frame-Options header to the affected pages or\
    \ resources, specifying the appropriate directive based on the application's requirements.\n\
    - The most common directives are:\n  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - This completely\
    \ disallows the website from being embedded in a frame, providing the highest\
    \ level of protection.\n  - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` - This allows the website\
    \ to be embedded only within pages served from the same origin (domain).\n- Ensure\
    \ that the X-Frame-Options header is set consistently across the entire web application\
    \ to maintain a robust and effective clickjacking protection mechanism.\n- Test\
    \ the changes thoroughly to verify that the X-Frame-Options header is correctly\
    \ implemented and that the website is no longer vulnerable to clickjacking attacks."
