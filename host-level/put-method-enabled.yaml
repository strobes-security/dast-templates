  name: PUT Method Enabled
  author: xElkomy
  severity: high
  description: The "PUT Method Enabled" vulnerability arises when a web server or
    application allows the use of the HTTP PUT method, which can enable an attacker
    to upload arbitrary content to the server. This could include malicious scripts,
    executables, or other files that could be used to compromise the server or conduct
    further attacks. Depending on the server's configuration, the uploaded content
    may be executed or serve as an entry point for the attacker to gain unauthorized
    access, disrupt the application's functionality, or leverage the server for additional
    malicious activities. Addressing this vulnerability typically involves disabling
    the PUT method globally or implementing strict controls to limit its use to only
    authorized and secure endpoints, accompanied by robust logging, monitoring, and
    regular auditing of the server's configuration.

  impact: '- An attacker could potentially upload malicious code, such as a shell
    script or executable, to the server by using the PUT method.

    - Depending on the server''s configuration, the attacker could use the uploaded
    content to compromise other users by serving client-executable scripts, or to
    compromise the server itself by executing server-side code.

    - The attacker could overwrite existing files on the server by using the PUT method
    to upload content to known file paths, potentially disrupting the application''s
    functionality or even gaining unauthorized access.

    - If the server is configured to execute the uploaded content, the attacker could
    potentially gain full control over the server and use it to launch further attacks
    or compromise other systems on the network.

    - The ability to upload arbitrary content to the server using the PUT method could
    also be used to bypass other security controls, such as input validation or access
    restrictions, leading to additional vulnerabilities or attack vectors.'
  remediation: 'To address the "PUT Method Enabled" vulnerability, the PUT method
    should be disabled or strictly controlled on the server. This can be done by implementing
    the following remediation steps:


    - Review the server''s configuration and identify all locations where the PUT
    method is enabled. This may include web server settings, application-specific
    configurations, or other infrastructure components.

    - Disable the PUT method globally on the server, either by modifying the web server
    configuration or applying a web application firewall (WAF) rule to block PUT requests.

    - If the PUT method is required for specific functionality, ensure that it is
    only enabled for the necessary endpoints and that strict access controls and input
    validation are in place to prevent the upload of malicious content.

    - Implement a robust logging and monitoring solution to detect and alert on any
    attempts to use the PUT method, as this can help identify potential attacks or
    misuse.

    - Regularly review and audit the server''s configuration to ensure that the PUT
    method remains disabled or appropriately controlled, and that no unexpected changes
    have been made.'
