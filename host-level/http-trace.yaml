  description: The HTTP TRACE method is a diagnostic tool that allows a client to
    send a request to the server and receive the exact same request back. While this
    can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, it poses a security risk if left enabled
    on production web servers. An attacker can exploit the TRACE method to perform
    cross-site tracing (XST) attacks, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive
    information, such as session cookies or other potentially sensitive data, that
    may be reflected in the server's response. This vulnerability can occur if the
    web server is configured to allow the use of the TRACE method, and it is considered
    a serious security concern as it can enable further attacks and compromise the
    confidentiality of user data.
  impact: '- An attacker could use the TRACE method to perform cross-site tracing
    (XST) attacks, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such
    as session cookies or other potentially sensitive data that may be reflected in
    the server''s response.

    - The attacker could exploit the TRACE method to gain access to sensitive user
    information, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the
    system.

    - The TRACE method can be used to bypass certain security controls, such as cross-site
    scripting (XSS) protection, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code on
    the victim''s browser.

    - If the server is configured to allow the use of the TRACE method, an attacker
    could leverage this vulnerability to perform further attacks, such as privilege
    escalation or lateral movement within the network.

    - The disclosure of sensitive information, such as session cookies or other user
    data, could enable the attacker to impersonate legitimate users, leading to unauthorized
    access to the system and its resources.'
  remediation: 'To address the "HTTP TRACE method enabled" vulnerability, the following
    remediation steps should be taken:


    The TRACE method should be disabled on the web server to mitigate the risk of
    cross-site tracing (XST) attacks and the potential disclosure of sensitive information.
    This can be achieved by configuring the web server to restrict the use of the
    TRACE method, ensuring that it is not accessible to clients. By removing the ability
    to use the TRACE method, the attack surface is reduced, and the risk of exploitation
    is significantly diminished.


    Specific steps for developers to follow:


    - Review the web server configuration and identify any settings that allow the
    use of the TRACE method.

    - Update the web server configuration to disable or restrict the TRACE method,
    following the guidelines and best practices provided by the web server vendor.

    - Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent the potential
    disclosure of sensitive information, even if the TRACE method is accidentally
    enabled in the future.

    - Regularly review and update the web server configuration to ensure that the
    TRACE method remains disabled and that the application is not vulnerable to related
    attacks.

    - Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) or other security controls
    to provide an additional layer of protection against TRACE method-related attacks.'
