  impact: '- Retrieve sensitive information stored in the application''s caches, such
    as authentication tokens, API keys, or other confidential data.

    - Manipulate or delete the application''s caches, potentially causing service
    disruptions or data loss.

    - Exploit any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the caching mechanism to
    gain unauthorized access to the application or its underlying infrastructure.

    - Leverage the information obtained from the caches to launch further attacks,
    such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.

    - Conduct reconnaissance on the application''s internal structure and functionality,
    which could aid in planning and executing more sophisticated attacks.'
  remediation: 'To address the "Springboot Actuator Caches" vulnerability, it is crucial
    to secure the access to the caches endpoint and ensure that sensitive information
    is not stored or exposed through this mechanism. This can be achieved by implementing
    the following measures:


    - Restrict access to the caches endpoint by implementing role-based access controls
    (RBAC) or other authentication and authorization mechanisms. Ensure that only
    authorized personnel or processes can access the caching information.

    - Evaluate the data stored in the application''s caches and remove or anonymize
    any sensitive information, such as authentication tokens, API keys, or other confidential
    data.

    - Configure the caching mechanism to follow the principle of least privilege,
    ensuring that the application only caches the minimum amount of information required
    for its operation.

    - Implement robust logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to
    any unauthorized access or suspicious activities related to the caching system.

    - Regularly review and update the caching configuration and policies to address
    any changes in the application''s requirements or the security landscape.'
