  author: Liwermor
  severity: info
  description: The "Mixed Active Content" vulnerability occurs when a webpage or application
    loads active content, such as scripts, plugins, or other resources, over an insecure
    HTTP connection, while the main page is served over a secure HTTPS connection.
    This mismatch in security protocols can enable an attacker to intercept and modify
    the active content, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the
    victim's system, steal sensitive information, or launch other types of client-side
    attacks. The vulnerability can also enable the attacker to bypass security mechanisms
    implemented by the browser, such as the same-origin policy, leading to cross-site
    scripting (XSS) attacks or session hijacking. To address this issue, organizations
    should ensure that all active content is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection,
    implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of active content,
    and regularly test their applications to identify and address any instances of
    mixed active content.

  impact: '- An attacker could intercept and modify the active content (e.g., scripts,
    plugins) loaded over an insecure HTTP connection, potentially enabling them to
    execute arbitrary code on the victim''s system or steal sensitive information.

    - The attacker could exploit the mixed active content vulnerability to launch
    man-in-the-middle attacks, where they can eavesdrop on the communication between
    the client and the server, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the
    data.

    - The mixed active content vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass the
    security mechanisms implemented by the browser, such as the same-origin policy,
    potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other types of client-side
    attacks.

    - An attacker could leverage the mixed active content issue to perform session
    hijacking, where they can gain unauthorized access to the user''s session and
    impersonate the legitimate user.

    - The mixed active content vulnerability could enable the attacker to conduct
    content injection attacks, where they can insert their own content (e.g., malicious
    advertisements, phishing pages) into the victim''s website, potentially compromising
    the user''s trust and exposing them to further attacks.'
  remediation: "To address the \"Mixed Active Content\" vulnerability, you should\
    \ ensure that all active content (such as scripts, plugins, and other resources)\
    \ is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection. This will help prevent potential man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks and protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.\
    \ \n\n- Identify all instances of active content loaded over HTTP and update the\
    \ corresponding code to use HTTPS instead.\n- Implement a Content Security Policy\
    \ (CSP) to further restrict the sources from which active content can be loaded,\
    \ ensuring that only trusted and secure sources are used.\n- Regularly test your\
    \ website or application to identify and address any new instances of mixed active\
    \ content that may arise due to changes in your codebase or third-party dependencies.\n\
    - Consider using a content delivery network (CDN) that supports HTTPS to serve\
    \ static assets, ensuring that all content is loaded over a secure connection.\n\
    - Ensure that your server is properly configured to serve HTTPS content and that\
    \ all appropriate security measures, such as SSL/TLS certificates and secure ciphers,\
    \ are in place."
