  impact: '- Potential unauthorized access to sensitive system information, such as
    server configurations, application source code, and database details.

    - Increased risk of further exploitation, as Xdebug can provide a foothold for
    an attacker to launch more advanced attacks.

    - Possibility of remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of
    the system and potentially escalate privileges.

    - Exposure of potentially confidential data to the attacker, which could be used
    for financial gain or other malicious purposes.

    - Increased likelihood of the system being targeted for additional attacks, as
    the presence of Xdebug may indicate other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.'
  remediation: 'To address the "WAMP Xdebug - Detect" vulnerability, it is crucial
    to disable the Xdebug functionality on the WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
    server. Xdebug is a powerful debugging tool, but if left enabled in a production
    environment, it can pose significant security risks by exposing sensitive system
    information and potentially allowing unauthorized access or remote code execution.


    - Verify the Xdebug extension is enabled in the PHP configuration file (php.ini)
    and disable it by removing or commenting out the relevant line(s).

    - Ensure that the Xdebug extension is not loaded automatically on startup by checking
    the system''s startup scripts or services.

    - Review the Apache configuration files and remove any references to Xdebug or
    debug-related directives.

    - Implement strict access control measures, such as firewall rules or network
    policies, to restrict access to the WAMP server and limit the exposure of the
    system to potential attackers.

    - Regularly monitor the system for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious
    activity, and implement robust logging and incident response procedures to promptly
    identify and address any security incidents.'
