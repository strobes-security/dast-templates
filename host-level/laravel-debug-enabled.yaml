  name: Laravel Debug Enabled
  author: notsoevilweasel
  severity: medium
  description: The vulnerability described relates to the improper configuration of
    Laravel's debug mode. When enabled, this feature can inadvertently disclose sensitive
    information, such as database connection details, file paths, and stack traces,
    which an attacker could leverage to gain further insights into the application's
    internals and potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could
    lead to a remote code execution vulnerability, compromising the system and enabling
    the attacker to plan and carry out more targeted attacks. The verbose error messages
    generated in debug mode may also reveal sensitive information that could be exploited
    to gain unauthorized access. To remediate this issue, it is recommended to disable
    Laravel's debug mode by setting the APP_DEBUG configuration parameter to false.
  remediation: 'To address the "Laravel Debug Enabled" vulnerability, it is crucial
    to ensure that the debug mode is disabled in the production environment. When
    debug mode is enabled, it can inadvertently expose sensitive information, such
    as database connection details, file paths, and stack traces, which an attacker
    could leverage to gain further insights into the application''s internals and
    potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to a remote
    code execution vulnerability, compromising the system and enabling the attacker
    to carry out more targeted attacks.


    To remediate this issue, follow these steps:


    - Verify the current configuration of the Laravel application and ensure that
    the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable is set to `false` in the production environment.

    - Review the application''s configuration files (e.g., `.env` file) and ensure
    that the `APP_DEBUG` parameter is set to `false`.

    - Implement a process to regularly review and validate the production environment''s
    configuration to prevent the accidental re-enabling of debug mode.

    - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect any unexpected changes
    in the application''s configuration or behavior that could indicate a potential
    compromise.

    - Educate the development team on the importance of properly configuring the production
    environment and the risks associated with leaving debug mode enabled.'

  impact: '- Attacker can obtain sensitive information, such as database connection
    details, file paths, and stack traces, which could aid in further attacks.

    - Attacker can potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to
    a remote code execution vulnerability.

    - Attacker can gain insights into the application''s internal structure and logic,
    which could be leveraged to identify and exploit other vulnerabilities.

    - Attacker can use the debug information to map out the application''s attack
    surface and plan more targeted attacks.

    - The verbose error messages can potentially disclose sensitive information that
    could be used to compromise the system or gain unauthorized access.'
