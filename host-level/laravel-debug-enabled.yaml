  impact: '- Attacker can obtain sensitive information, such as database connection
    details, file paths, and stack traces, which could aid in further attacks.

    - Attacker can potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to
    a remote code execution vulnerability.

    - Attacker can gain insights into the application''s internal structure and logic,
    which could be leveraged to identify and exploit other vulnerabilities.

    - Attacker can use the debug information to map out the application''s attack
    surface and plan more targeted attacks.

    - The verbose error messages can potentially disclose sensitive information that
    could be used to compromise the system or gain unauthorized access.'
